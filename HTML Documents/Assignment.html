        This is the body part of my page. I'm going to put in a quote here too.
        <blockquote cite="https://www.sunnyskyz.com/good-news/3455/Colombians-Planted-200-000-Trees-In-One-Day">
                Through the Bosques de Vida seeding, 200,000 trees were planted throughout the department, thanks to the joint work between the community and the environmental, local and regional authorities of Antioquia.

                These trees add to the goal of the National Development Plan Pact for Colombia, Pact for Equity to plant 180 million trees in the country over the next four years.
                
                More than 400 people joined the planting of 200,000 trees in 125 municipalities.

                "Today in the sowing of Antioquia 200,000 trees were planted and in two months we will be able to plant 400,000 more," said Ricardo Lozano, the Minister of Environment.
